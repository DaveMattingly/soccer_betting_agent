Soccer Betting Agent uses Machine Learning to train an agent to analyze betting markets in European soccer leagues.  The agent may place bets of varying size on Home, Draw, Away, Over, Under, and Handicap markets, and gets trained on the results.



The program was built in Python, and requires installation of the stable\_baselines3, gymnasium, and pandas packages.



Odds data was obtained through www.football-data.co.uk. Data on the strength of teams was obtained using clubelo.com.



Please note that, as of right now, I have only been able to prove the null hypothesis - that given the current settings and data points used, there is no reasonable exploitable inefficiency in the market.
